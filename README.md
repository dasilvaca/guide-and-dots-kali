# What about this repo?

This repository contains the most interesting packages I use to my daily work on linux. For now. I am using kali-linux. But, I'll try to find packages available on every common repositories and major platforms. Like Arch, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, etc. (My philosophy is: if it's available for Debian, it must be available for the others. With the exception of Arch, of course, but, it's probably that them could be available for Arch too).

## Why?

Well, because when I was a newbie on linux, I had a lot of problems to find the best packages to my daily work. I had to search a lot of time to find the best packages for my needs. And, I had to install a lot of packages to find the best ones. So, I decided to create this repository to help the newbies on linux. And, to help the oldies too. I hope this repository could help you too.

Also, because when I will migrate to another distro, I would like to keep my favorite packages and their cofigurations.

## Interesting packages

Here I will list the packages I use by category.

### General

### Window managers, compositors and things I use to customize them

- [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/): A tiling window manager. I use it because it's very customizable and it's very fast.
- [Dunst](https://dunst-project.org/): A notification daemon. I use it to display my notifications.

### Shells and terminals

- [Terminator](https://terminator-gtk3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): A terminal emulator. I use it because I can get a personalized color palette I made on terminal.sexy... It has some feutures as multitab, split screen, etc.
- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/): A shell. I prefer it over bash because itś more customizable and faster. I use it to run my scripts and to run my servers.
- [Oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/): A framework for zsh. Itś highly customizable and still fast fast. It has extensions as auto-completion, syntax highlighting, etc.

### Text editors

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/): A light text editor, used mainly on CLI, it's very customizable and it's very fast. I use it to write my scripts when I need to take a fast note, or to practice my vim skills and fast coding without any extre feautures. I need to learn more of it and which plugins are the best for me.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A text editor with lots of available plugins and formatters that seems useful.I use it when I need to debug or develop a large project, is the best tool I have. I am thinking in list the plugins I use... But maybe later. The installation of this text editor is tricky. I had to add it repository to my source.list and then install it.

### Package Managers
